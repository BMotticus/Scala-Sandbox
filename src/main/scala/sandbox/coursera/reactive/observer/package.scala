/** {{{ Imperative Event Handling: The Observer Pattern }}}
  * `The Observer Pattern` is commonly used when we have some sort of {{{Model that maintains the state of an application}}}, 
  * and we need to have one or more {{{Views that present the properties of the model}}} in some way.
  *
  * `Variants` of the observer pattern are also called: 
  *   1. publish/subscribe
  *   2. model/view/controller (MVC)
  *
  * Using publish/subscribe:
  *   Subscribe method
  *     `Views` can announce themselves to the `Model` with an operation which we call ``subscribe``.
  *   Publish method
  *     Whenever there's a change, the `Model` will ``publish`` that new information to the `Views`.
  *   You can then inquire the `Model` about what the new state is and change it's `presentations`. 
  *   There could be more than one `View` that also `subscribes` itself and gets the same `published` information. 
  *
  * Using model/view/controller:
  *   Sometimes in using interfaces, we have a third component` which is called a ``controller``, 
  *   which somehow manages the interactions between the `model` and the `view`.
